# Firebase LogSnag Extension (Unofficial)

[**Install the extension using this link**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/extensions/install?ref=nikkothari22/firebase-logsnag-extension)

**Author**: Nikhil Kothari (**[https://github.com/nikkothari22](https://github.com/nikkothari22)**)

**Description**: Functions to send events and insights to LogSnag. (Not an official extension)

**This is not an official Logsnag extension and the author is not associated with LogSnag or Firebase in any manner whatsoever. All trademarks and copyrights belong to the respective companies.**

**Details**: Use this extension to publish events and insights to your LogSnag channel. The extension uses the official [LogSnag Node.js library](https://docs.logsnag.com/official-libraries/node.js).

You need to have a LogSnag account and get the authentication (Access) token and the project name (refer to the LogSnag documentation for this). When you need to publish an event or insight, simply create a new document in Firestore.

The extension has a cloud function that's triggered whenever a new document is created in the collections specified during installation.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension to publish an event in LogSnag:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('logsnagEvents').add({
    channel: "waitlist",
    event: "User Joined",
    description: "Email: john@example.com",
    icon: "ðŸŽ‰",
    tags: {
      name: "john doe",
      email: "john@example.com",
    },
    notify: true
})
```

To publish an insight, you would need to write a document in another collection:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('logsnagInsights').add({
    title: "User Count",
    value: "100",
    icon: "ðŸ‘¨"
})
```
